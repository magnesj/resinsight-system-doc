In some cases, shader support is not available. This is the case when ResInsight is used over a Remote Desktop connection on Windows. 

Download [OS Mesa](https://www.mesa3d.org/osmesa.html) and

Copy the files following files from **mesa-binaries\x64**  into the same folder as ResInsight.exe :

    libglapi.dll 
    opengl32.dll
